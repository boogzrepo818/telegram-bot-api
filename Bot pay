Building a Telegram bot to read credit card NFC/EMV data is a complex task that requires expertise in:

1. Telegram Bot API
2. NFC/EMV technology
3. Payment industry regulations (PCI-DSS)
4. Security measures
5. Artificial intelligence (AI) and data analysis

Here's a high-level overview of the steps to build a Telegram bot:

1. *Create a Telegram bot account*:
    - Talk to the BotFather bot in Telegram to create a new bot and receive an API token.
2. *Choose a programming language*:
    - Select a language like Python, JavaScript, or Ruby to develop your bot.
3. *Use a Telegram Bot API library*:
    - Utilize a library like python-telegram-bot or node-telegram-bot-api to interact with the Telegram Bot API.
4. *Integrate NFC/EMV reader functionality*:
    - Use a library or framework that supports NFC/EMV reader functionality, such as OpenEMV or Javacard.
5. *Implement PCI-DSS compliance and security measures*:
    - Ensure your bot meets payment industry regulations and implements appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data.
6. *Integrate AI components and data analysis*:
    - Use machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or scikit-learn to analyze and make decisions based on the EMV data.
7. *Develop a conversation flow*:
    - Create a conversation flow that guides users through the process of reading their credit card data and providing consent.
8. *Test and deploy your bot*:
    - Test your bot thoroughly and deploy it to a server or cloud platform.

Some popular libraries and frameworks for building Telegram bots include:

- Python: python-telegram-bot, python-telegram-bot-library
- JavaScript: node-telegram-bot-api, telegram-bot-sdk
